  "description":"<p>In <b>Solo for Piano</b>, individual pitch intervals function as subjects of a musical drama which unfolds within contrasting sections. Paul Hindemith's ranking of intervals (from consonant to dissonant, his \"series 2\") is appropriated and explored as a raga might be explored in an Indian improvisation. Notated accelerandos, ritardandos and an anomalous rhythmic practice result in moments of rubato-like flux, but recurrances of material contribute to a sense of stability and a degree of formal symmetry, in spite of the pervasive process of continual variation.</p><p class='c-cite is-small'>John Van der Slice</p>",
