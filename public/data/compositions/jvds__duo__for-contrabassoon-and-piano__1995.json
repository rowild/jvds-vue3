  "description":"<p>The <b>Duo for Contrabassoon and Piano</b> was commissioned by <b>Henry Skolnick</b>. It involves continual variation of material and, despite the use of serial methods of pitch organization which partially determine the character of certain sections, there is often the hint of a kind of extended tonality. After a succession of abrupt textural contrasts the music eventually takes on a focus of continuity and momentum which culminates in a surprisingly light-hearted stylistic allusion before losing control and collapsing into a relatively sedate close.</p>",
