  "description":"<p><b>Solo for Cello</b> was written especially for <b>Craig Hultgren</b>. It uses an assured, declamatory Eb major triad at the beginning of the piece as a point of departure into an underworld of mercurial uncertainties and extreme states. A stasis of mysterious, fragmentary and contrasting \"moments\" is arrived at, but is eventually interrupted by a sudden surge of resolve. This culminates in a climactic high point followed by a protracted, agonized decent into what might be considered as the \"charred remains\" of the initial Eb triad.</p>",
