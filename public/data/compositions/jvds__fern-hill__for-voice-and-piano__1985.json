  "description":"<p><b>Fern Hill</b> is a setting of that poem written by the Welsh lyric poet Dylan Thomas, who died tragically of alcoholism in 1953 at the age of 39. The introductory ebb and flow of the cello is intended to suggest the gothic timelessness of the Welsh sea-coast. From this emerges the recollection of transient childhood joys, memories existing in the shadow of the poet's awareness of inevitable mortality, the poigniancy of which is captured in the poem's final lines:</p><p>\"Time held me green and dying<br>Though I sang in my chains like the sea.\"</p><p class='c-cite is-small'>John Van der Slice</p>",
